Name: Lexical Analyzer

What did the application do: The Lexical Analyzer was my first major application. It was a program that scanned C source code and identified the different tokens in the code. The tokens could be keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, or symbols.

What were the inputs: The input to the Lexical Analyzer was a C source code file.

What were the outputs: The output of the Lexical Analyzer was a sequence of tokens, along with their type.

What was the tech stack: The Lexical Analyzer was implemented in the C programming language.

What were the main challenges: The main challenges in implementing the Lexical Analyzer were:

Identifying the different types of tokens in the C language.
Handling special cases, such as comments and string literals.
Efficiently scanning the source code.
Lexical Analysis in C

Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It is responsible for breaking down the source code into a sequence of tokens. A token is the smallest unit of meaning in a programming language. It can be a keyword, identifier, constant, string literal, or symbol.

Lexical analysis in C can be implemented using a variety of methods. One common approach is to use a finite state machine (FSM). An FSM is a model of computation that can be used to recognize patterns in a sequence of input symbols.

To implement lexical analysis using an FSM, we need to define a set of states for the FSM, one for each type of token that we want to recognize. We also need to define a set of transitions between the states. The transitions are triggered by input symbols.

When the Lexical Analyzer starts, it is in the initial state. It then reads the next input symbol and transitions to the next state based on the current state and the input symbol. The Lexical Analyzer continues to read input symbols and transition to new states until it reaches a final state.

When the Lexical Analyzer reaches a final state, it has recognized a token. The Lexical Analyzer then outputs the token and resets to the initial state.

Lexical analysis is an important part of compiler design. It is responsible for breaking down the source code into a sequence of tokens that can be understood by the rest of the compiler.
